== 3.1.7 == 25/02/2019
  - Fixed a few bugs around the Python interface (thanks @DavidToneian and @kagalengo-m-b).
  - Several fixes to the parser on corner cases.
  - Minor fixes to the MATLAB interface. 

== 3.1.6 ==
  - Minor fixes

== 3.1.5 == 08/04/2017
  - Added a mps_parse_string routine.
  - Lot of fixes and redesign on xmpsolve.
  - Various bug fixes inside MPSolve.

== 3.1.4 == 19/10/2013
  - Fixed a lot of bugs in the parser.
  - Improved support to Chebyshev polynomials. 
  - Added a python interface to MPSolve. 
  - Installation the Octave module as a package. 

== 3.1.3 == 29/03/2013
  - Rewritten from scratch the improvement engine, in a way more suitable
    to be parallelized. This solve problems present in 3.1.2 and 3.1.1. 
  - Adjustment to documentation and the build system. 

== 3.1.2 == 
  - Various other fixes to the build system
  - Review of the improvement routine

== 3.1.1 == 21/03/2013
 - Fixes to the build system, to make sure that builds of some modules
   are not tried if the libraries on the systems are too old. 

== 3.1.0 == 20/03/2013
 - Reworked the system of dealing with user polynomial, that is now
   a lot more flexible. 
 - Introduction of an initial Aberth floating point packet in the algorithm
   MPS_ALGORITHM_SECULAR_GA that gives performance boosts on easy polynomials. 
 - Reworked the regeneration of secular equations to be more performant.
 - Various consintency fixes
 - Introduced Jacobi-style iterations of Aberth, and allow the user to select
   the desired one at runtime
 - Small API changes to retrieve the results of a computation. 
 - Reworked improve routine that is more performant than the old one. 
 - Added a graphical debugger for the iterations. 
 - Added a graphical user interface for MPSolve, called xmpsolve. 
 - Added support for polynomials represented in the Chebyshev base. 
 - All the polynomial types (event secular equations) are now multithread, except
   the Chebyshev polynomials. 
 - Modified the Octave module to be compilable under more architectures. 
 - Reworked the headers to make MPSolve usable directly from C++.

== 3.0.1 == 19/02/2013
 - Fixed some bugs in unisolve that caused early exists
   without full approximation of some roots. 
 - Correction in the Octave module to ease compilation
   on all targets. 
 - Corrected a bug in the floating point shift
 - Slight optimizations on algorithm MPS_ALGORITHM_SECULAR_GA.
 - Corrections in the Matlab (TM) module. 

== 3.0.0 == 03/12/2012
 - First open source release of MPSolve
 - Implemented the secular solver as an alternative to the classical one
 - Support for solving secular equations
 - Parallelization of most of the parts of the algorithm
